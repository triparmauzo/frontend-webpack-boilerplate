## What is Shkarko Murlan?

## How to Play Shkarko Murlan?
 
The game starts with each player receiving 13 cards. The player who has the 3 of clubs starts the game by playing any card or combination of cards of the same rank. For example, they can play a single 3, a pair of 3s, or a four-of-a-kind of 3s. The next player has to play a higher card or combination of cards of the same rank. For example, if the previous player played a pair of 3s, the next player can play a pair of 4s or higher. If they cannot play a higher card or combination of cards of the same rank, they have to pass. The player who plays the highest card or combination of cards of the same rank wins the trick and starts the next trick. The round ends when one player has no cards left in their hand. The player who finishes first becomes the President in the next round, the player who finishes second becomes the Vice-President, the player who finishes third becomes the Vice-Asshole, and the player who finishes last becomes the Asshole.
 
In the second round (Kateri), each player receives four cards from the deck. The President can exchange two cards with the Asshole, and the Vice-President can exchange one card with the Vice-Asshole. The President starts the game by playing any card or combination of cards of the same rank. The rules are the same as in the first round.
 
In the third round (Dyshi), each player receives two cards from the deck. The President can exchange one card with the Asshole. The President starts the game by playing any card or combination of cards of the same rank. The rules are the same as in the first round.
 
The game ends after three rounds. The player who has been President for most rounds wins the game.
