# Kitab ul Hind: A Historical Account of India by Al-Biruni
 
Kitab ul Hind (The Book of India) is a famous book written by Abu Rayhan al-Biruni, a renowned scholar and polymath of the 11th century. Al-Biruni was born in Khwarezm (present-day Uzbekistan) and traveled to India as part of the entourage of Mahmud of Ghazni, the Muslim conqueror who invaded the subcontinent several times. Al-Biruni spent about 13 years in India, studying its culture, religion, geography, astronomy, mathematics, and history. He learned Sanskrit and consulted various Hindu scriptures and scholars. He also conducted experiments and observations to verify or correct the information he gathered.

Kitab ul Hind is the result of al-Biruni's extensive research and analysis of India. It is divided into 80 chapters, covering topics such as the geography, climate, flora and fauna, history, politics, society, caste system, customs, festivals, languages, literature, sciences, arts, philosophy, and religion of India. Al-Biruni also compares and contrasts the Indian culture with the Islamic and Persian cultures, highlighting the similarities and differences. He also criticizes some aspects of both cultures, such as superstitions, idolatry, polytheism, and social inequalities.
 
Kitab ul Hind is considered one of the most comprehensive and objective accounts of India written by a foreigner. It is also a valuable source of information about the state of science and civilization in India and the Islamic world in the 11th century. Al-Biruni's work influenced many later scholars and travelers who visited or wrote about India.
 
Kitab ul Hind was originally written in Arabic, but it was later translated into several languages, including Persian, Turkish, Hebrew, Latin, English, French, German, and Urdu. The Urdu translation was done by Syed Ali Asghar in 1941 and published by Anjuman Taraqqi Urdu (Hind), Delhi[^1^] [^2^]. The book is available online in PDF format for free download from various websites[^3^] [^4^].
  
One of the most remarkable features of Kitab ul Hind is al-Biruni's scientific approach and curiosity. He does not rely on hearsay or tradition, but rather tests and verifies the facts he encounters. For example, he measures the latitude and longitude of various places in India using astronomical instruments and calculations. He also corrects some errors and misconceptions in the Indian astronomy and astrology, such as the size and distance of the planets, the causes of eclipses, and the precession of the equinoxes. He also discusses the Indian system of numerals, which he praises for its simplicity and efficiency. He introduces the concept of zero and the decimal place value system to the Islamic world, which later facilitated the development of algebra and arithmetic.
 
Another notable aspect of Kitab ul Hind is al-Biruni's respect and appreciation for the Indian culture and religion. He does not judge or condemn the beliefs and practices of the Hindus, but rather tries to understand them from their own perspective. He explains the concepts of Brahman, Atman, karma, reincarnation, dharma, moksha, yoga, and the four stages of life. He also describes the various sects and schools of Hinduism, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Lokayata. He also mentions some of the famous Indian sages and philosophers, such as Vyasa, Valmiki, Patanjali, Kapila, Kanada, Gautama Buddha, Mahavira, and Charvaka.
 
Kitab ul Hind is a testament to al-Biruni's intellectual curiosity and cultural tolerance. It is also a reflection of the rich and diverse heritage of India and its interaction with other civilizations. It is a book that deserves to be read and studied by anyone interested in the history and culture of India.
