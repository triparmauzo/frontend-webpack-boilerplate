- **DeNoise**: This plug-in is designed to reduce noise such as hiss, wind noise, buzz and camera noise. The noise can be reduced automatically in the adaptive mode or after measuring the characteristics of the noise in the noise profile mode. New in version 2 are dynamic noise profiles that capture the dynamic properties of the noise so that noise that fluctuates over time, such as wind noise, can be effectively reduced. The new algorithm has also been greatly improved and is now even less prone to typical de-noising artifacts.
- **DeHum**: This plug-in targets hum and buzz typically introduced by poorly grounded electrical equipment, but also other tonal noise sources like electrical motor noise. The hum detection algorithm has been improved in version 2 and there's now a new Scan button that automatically fine tunes the fundamental hum frequency. Version 2 also supports Mid/Side (M/S) processing, which can reduce unwanted fluctuations in the stereo image.
- **DeClick**: This plug-in is designed to remove impulsive noise such as clicks, crackle and thumps. These distortions are frequently encountered on LP and 78 RPM records, but also occur in digital recordings due to drop-outs or distorted data packets. DeClick 2's thump reduction works also effectively on vocal recordings with unwanted plosives. The algorithm has been improved in version 2 and is now less prone to reducing attacks and transients in the wanted signal. Version 2 also supports Mid/Side (M/S) processing.
- **DeClip**: This plug-in restores audio recordings distorted by analog or digital clipping with an improved algorithm. Version 2 offers even more impressive reconstruction of clipped signal peaks.

Acon Digital Restoration Suite has been praised by many professional audio engineers and musicians for its high quality and ease of use. Some of the testimonials are:

> "By 'FAR', the best NR that I've ever heard!" - David Miles Huber, 4X Grammy-nominated artist

> "An excellent sounding, well designed suite of plug-ins that's great for quick and easy restoration work." - Sound on Sound Magazine
