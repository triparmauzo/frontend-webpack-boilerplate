## How to Practice Conducting
 
Practicing conducting is essential for developing and improving your skills as a conductor. You can practice conducting by yourself or with others, using recordings or live music, and with or without a baton. Here are some tips for conducting practice techniques that can help you refine your form and expressiveness.
 
- Downbeats: To practice hitting the focal point of each downbeat, you can tape some paper to a wall and hold a pen in each hand. Conduct downbeats with your arms and try to keep the strokes in the same place on the paper. You can also use a table or a friend's open palms as a reference for your focal point. Think of the focal point as a hot plate that you want to touch briefly and flick downwards.[^1^]
- Conducting patterns: To practice different conducting patterns, such as two, three, or four beats per measure, you can use a metronome or a recording of music that matches the time signature. Conduct along with the beat and make sure your hands and arms move smoothly and clearly through each part of the pattern. Pay attention to the direction, shape, and size of your gestures.[^1^]
- Musical expression: To practice conveying musical expression through your conducting, you can use recordings of music that have different dynamics, tempos, articulations, and emotions. Conduct along with the music and try to show the changes and nuances of the music through your gestures. Use your face, eyes, and body language to communicate with the musicians.[^3^]

## How to Conduct a Remote Interview
 
Remote interviewing is becoming more common and important in the modern workplace, especially in the wake of the pandemic and the Great Resignation. Remote interviewing can be challenging for both employers and candidates, as they have to rely on technology and screen communication to make a good impression. Here are some tips for conducting an excellent remote interview that can help you identify and attract top talent from a distance.

- Focus on emotional intelligence: Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to relate to others, adapt to change, handle stress, and work well in a team. EQ is often more critical than skills or intelligence (IQ) for success in the workplace. When conducting a remote interview, you can assess a candidate's EQ by asking questions that reveal their values, conflict management, feedback receptiveness, and motivation.[^2^]
- Lean into the intimacy of the screen: While screens can limit some aspects of communication, they can also create a sense of intimacy between you and your candidate. You can use this to your advantage by making eye contact, smiling, nodding, and showing genuine interest in what they have to say. You can also use small talk and humor to break the ice and build rapport.[^2^]
- Prepare for technical issues: Remote interviewing depends on technology, which can sometimes fail or malfunction. To avoid or minimize technical issues, you should test your equipment and internet connection before the interview. You should also have a backup plan in case something goes wrong during the interview, such as switching to another platform or rescheduling the interview.[^4^]
