Probability, statistics and random processes are not only theoretical concepts, but also have many practical applications in various fields of engineering, science and technology. The book illustrates some of these applications with examples and problems from areas such as communications, signal processing, queueing theory and mathematical finance. For instance, the book shows how to use probability models to analyze the performance of communication systems, such as error detection and correction codes, modulation schemes and channel models. The book also explains how to use statistical methods to estimate unknown parameters, test hypotheses and design experiments. The book also introduces the concept of random processes, which are collections of random variables that evolve over time or space. The book describes how to characterize and process random processes, such as Markov chains, Poisson processes and Gaussian processes. The book also demonstrates how to apply random processes to model phenomena such as noise, interference, arrival patterns and stock prices.
 
The book is designed to help students develop the skills and intuition necessary to solve real-world problems involving probability, statistics and random processes. The book uses a software-oriented approach, illustrating the importance of software for carrying out simulations when answers to questions cannot be obtained analytically. The book provides examples and problems in R and MATLAB, including code so students can create their own simulations. The book also encourages students to use online resources, such as SpringerLink[^1^] and IEEE Xplore[^2^], to access additional materials and references. The book also includes supplementary materials on the publisher's website, such as three sample syllabi, updated solutions manuals for both instructors and students, lecture slides and figures and tables from the text.
