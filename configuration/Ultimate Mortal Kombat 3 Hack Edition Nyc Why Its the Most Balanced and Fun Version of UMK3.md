The hack was created by Scott Hussain, a passionate Mortal Kombat fan from New York City, who uploaded his work on SoundCloud[^4^]. He claims that he spent over two years working on the hack, using various tools and resources from the online community of rom hackers. He says that his goal was to create a definitive version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 that would appeal to both casual and hardcore players.
 
Some of the main features of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Hack Edition Nyc are:
 
- Sheeva is finally playable, with her own vs. screen and finishers.
- 16 arenas in total, including 9 MK3 arenas that were removed from the original game, with pit and stage fatalities.

- Rain and Noob Saibot are available for battle in the towers, with their own fatalities.
- The subway arena has a moving train animation.
- 3x3 mode, where you can choose three fighters and switch between them during the match.
- Mortal Kombat Trilogy sound effects.
- Shang Tsung can transform into Rain.
- Menu codes in just one button.
- The rooftop, the street, the subway and bell tower stages have no black bars on the floor.
- A new character called Idels/Chameleon, who can use moves and powers from other fighters.

The hack is compatible with MAME emulator[^3^], and can be downloaded from Archive.org[^5^]. It is based on another hack called Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Deluxe[^2^], which was created by Lucas Dext5r. The hack also draws inspiration from other hacks such as Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 - Arcade Hack[^1^], Mortal Kombat Revelations[^1^] and Ultimate Mortal Kombat Trilogy[^1^].
 
If you are a fan of Mortal Kombat or fighting games in general, you should definitely give Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Hack Edition Nyc a try. It is a fresh and exciting way to experience a classic game that still holds up today. Just be prepared for some intense and bloody kombat!
  
Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Hack Edition Nyc is not only a tribute to the original game, but also a homage to the history of Mortal Kombat 3 and its evolution over the years. Mortal Kombat 3 was released in arcades in 1995, as the third main installment in the Mortal Kombat franchise and a sequel to 1993's Mortal Kombat II[^1^]. The game introduced new features such as combos, run button, kombat kodes and animalities, but also omitted several popular characters from previous games, such as Scorpion, Johnny Cage and Raiden. The game also changed the tone and setting of the series, moving away from the mystical and oriental themes of the first two games and focusing on a more modern and dystopian scenario of Earthrealm being invaded by Shao Kahn and his forces[^1^].

The game received generally positive reviews from critics and fans, but also drew some criticism for its changes and omissions. As a result, Midway decided to update the game with two titles that added back some of the missing characters and features, as well as introducing new ones. The first update was Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, which was released in arcades later in 1995. This version added back Scorpion, Kitana, Jade, Reptile and Mileena, as well as introducing new characters such as Ermac, Classic Sub-Zero and Human Smoke. It also added new stages, modes and secrets[^2^]. The second update was Mortal Kombat Trilogy, which was released for various home consoles in 1996. This version included all the characters and stages from Mortal Kombat 3 and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as well as adding back some characters from Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat II, such as Johnny Cage, Raiden, Baraka and Kintaro. It also added new features such as Aggressor mode, Brutality finishers and Khameleon[^2^].
