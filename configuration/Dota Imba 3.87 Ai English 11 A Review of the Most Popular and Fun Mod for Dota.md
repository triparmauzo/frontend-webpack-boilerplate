- Choose your hero wisely. Dota Imba has over 100 heroes to choose from, each with their own unique abilities and items. Some heroes are more suited for certain game modes, mutations, or team compositions than others. For example, heroes with global or long-range abilities can benefit from the mutation that increases cast range, while heroes with high mobility or escape skills can avoid the mutation that disables blink effects. You can also check the hero ratings on the pick screen to see which heroes are more popular or successful in the current patch.
- Experiment with different builds. Dota Imba has a lot of custom items that can drastically change your hero's performance and playstyle. Some items are exclusive to certain heroes, while others are available to everyone. You can also upgrade some items to make them more powerful or add new effects. For example, you can upgrade your Boots of Travel to allow you to teleport to any allied unit or structure, or you can upgrade your Dagon to deal more damage and have a lower cooldown. Don't be afraid to try new combinations and see what works best for you.
- Be aware of your surroundings. Dota Imba has a lot of map changes that can affect your gameplay. For example, there are more runes that spawn every two minutes, some of which have unique effects like granting invulnerability or spawning illusions. There are also more neutral camps that drop different items or buffs when killed. There are also special events that occur randomly throughout the game, such as Roshan's rampage, where he will attack any nearby hero or structure, or the meteor shower, where meteors will fall from the sky and deal damage to anyone caught in their impact zone. Pay attention to these events and use them to your advantage or avoid them if necessary.
- Communicate with your team. Dota Imba is a team game, where coordination and cooperation can make a big difference. You can use the chat or voice commands to communicate with your allies and plan your strategies. For example, you can ping the map to indicate where you want to go or where you need help, or you can use the chat wheel to say things like "Well played" or "Get back". You can also use the scoreboard to see your team's stats and items, as well as the enemy's. This can help you decide what items to buy or what heroes to focus on.
- Have fun! Dota Imba is a game mode that is meant to be fun and enjoyable for everyone. Don't take it too seriously or get too frustrated if things don't go your way. Remember that it's just a custom game and not a competitive one. Try to have a positive attitude and respect your teammates and opponents. You can also compliment them for their good plays or joke around with them if they make mistakes. The most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the game!
