Chon Wang decides to go to London with his old friend Roy O'Bannon, a former outlaw turned waiter and gigolo. Along the way, they encounter many obstacles and challenges, such as a street urchin named Charlie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who turns out to be the future Charlie Chaplin, a Scotland Yard inspector named Artie Doyle (Tom Fisher), who is inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle, and a mysterious assassin named Rathbone (Aidan Gillen), who is working for Wu Chow.
