## What are USB drivers and why do you need them?
 
USB drivers are software programs that enable the computer to recognize and interact with USB devices. Without USB drivers, the computer will not be able to detect your Hipstreet device when you connect it via a USB cable. This means you will not be able to transfer files, backup data, update firmware, root, install custom ROMs, or perform any other tasks that require a connection between your Hipstreet device and your computer.
 
There are two types of USB drivers for Hipstreet devices:
 
- Generic ADB drivers: These are universal drivers that can work with most Android devices. They are useful for performing basic tasks such as transferring files or enabling USB debugging.
- OEM drivers: These are specific drivers that are provided by the manufacturer of your Hipstreet device. They are required for performing more advanced tasks such as updating firmware, unlocking bootloader, or rooting.
